## üîß 
**Authentication State Handling Fixed**

### Issues Resolved:
- **Hydration Problem**: Fixed Zustand persistence causing immediate redirects before localStorage hydration
- **Loading States**: Added proper loading indicators during authentication state hydration
- **Consistent Auth Flow**: Authentication state now persists correctly across page refreshes

### Technical Improvements:
- Added `_hasHydrated` flag to track when Zustand store has loaded from localStorage
- Updated `useAuthGuard` hook to wait for hydration before redirecting
- Added loading spinners during authentication state resolution
- Proper error handling for authentication edge cases

### Console Error Note:
The console error `TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'current')` is from a Chrome extension (`chrome-extension://kljjoeapehcmaphfcjkmbhkinoaopdnd/`) and not from our application code. This is a common issue with browser extensions trying to interact with web pages and can be safely ignored.

## üöÄ **Current Behavior:**
- If you're already logged in as an investor, `/` will redirect directly to `/investor`
- `/investor/companies` will work immediately if authenticated
- Proper loading states prevent flash of redirects
- Authentication persists across browser sessions
