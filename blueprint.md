# Blueprint: Persistent State Management (Completed)

## Overview

This blueprint outlines the plan to fix the state management issues in the application. The current state is not persistent, leading to a poor user experience where the founder profile completion steps reset and notifications reappear after a page refresh.

## Plan

1.  **Integrate Zustand `persist` middleware:** I will add the `persist` middleware to the existing Zustand stores (`app-store.ts` and `founder-store.ts`). This will automatically save the application state to `localStorage` and rehydrate it on page load.

2.  **Update Founder Store:** I will add the `setCurrentStep` to the founder store to manage the current step of the multi-step form.

3.  **Update `CompanyDetailsForm.tsx`:** I will ensure the `onComplete` prop in the `CompanyDetailsForm` component properly updates the current step in the founder store.

## Implementation Details

*   **`app-store.ts`:**
    *   Import `persist` from `zustand/middleware`.
    *   Wrap the `create` function with the `persist` middleware.
    *   Configure the middleware to persist the entire `AppState`.

*   **`founder-store.ts`:**
    *   Import `persist` from `zustand/middleware`.
    *   Wrap the `create` function with the `persist` middleware.
    *   Configure the middleware to persist the entire `FounderState`.
    *   Add a `setCurrentStep` function to the store.

*   **`CompanyDetailsForm.tsx`:**
    *   Refactored the `onFilesChange` handlers in the `FileUploadsStep` to use `React.useCallback` to prevent infinite re-renders.

By implementing these changes, the application state will be preserved across page reloads, resolving the reported issues and improving the overall user experience.
